# Bash Automation Scripts

These scripts cover a range of practical scenarios including AWS CLI integration, system monitoring, log parsing, user management, and more.

---

## Repository Structure

Each script is organized into its own folder with a descriptive name. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `exec.sh` â€” The executable Bash script implementing the task.
- `README.md` â€” A detailed explanation of what the script does, how to use it, and any prerequisites.

Example folder structure:

```
list-all-s3-buckets/
  â”œâ”€â”€ exec.sh
  â””â”€â”€ README.md
for-simple/
  â”œâ”€â”€ exec.sh
backup-logs/
  â”œâ”€â”€ exec.sh
  â””â”€â”€ README.md
...
```
